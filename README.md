### Setting up the sanity project

You need to create a sanity project to work with this portfolio. This can be done by running this in the root of the app

```bash
pnpm create sanity@latest
```

This will prompt you to do a few things

1. Login to your sanity
1. Create a new project
1. Don't add configuration files (this has already been done for you)
1. Select `clean project with no predefined schemas`. You can delete the newly created sanity changes
1. Go to the [Sanity dashboard](https://www.sanity.io/manage) and select your project to view your project ID and other details
